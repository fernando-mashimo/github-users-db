# github-users-db

A simple application to retrieve, persist, and display GitHub users' data via CLI commands. It is designed to run in Node.js (version 18 or higher recommended).

## Pre-requisites

Before running any command in your terminal, ensure the following:

- **Node.js** is installed (version 18 or later recommended):
  - Run the command `node -v` in your terminal.
    - If the output is like `v18.xx.y`, you're good to go.
    - Otherwise, you'll need to install Node.js.
      - First, install **NVM**: [NVM Installation Guide](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
      - Then, use NVM to install Node.js.

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** are installed and ready:
  - If you donâ€™t have Docker or Docker Compose, please follow these links:
    - [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
    - [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

- You have a **GitHub Personal Access Token (Classic)**:
  - If you haven't created one yet, follow the guide here: [Creating a Personal Access Token (Classic)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic)

- You've created a `.env` file in the project root directory with the following variables:
  ```bash
  GITHUB_API_TOKEN="your GitHub personal access token"
  DB_HOST=localhost
  DB_PORT=5432
  DB_NAME=github-db
  DB_USER=postgres
  DB_PASSWORD=postgres
  ```

## Setting up the Local Environment
To get the application up and running, follow these steps:
1. Run ``npm install`` to install the required Node packages.
2. Run ``docker compose up -d`` to start the database container.
3. Run ``npm run migrations`` to create the necessary database tables.
    - Alternatively, you can run ``npm run migrations:seeds`` to also seed the database with fictional data.

4. Run ``npm link`` to make the CLI application globally available (you will then be able to run it using the ``gh-users`` command).

## Running the CLI App
### Main Commands
Once all pre-requisites are set up, you can use the following commands in your terminal:
- ``gh-users fetch <GitHub username>``: Fetch a user's data from GitHub (using the official public API) and persist it in your local PostgreSQL database.
  - Example: ``gh-users fetch fernando-mashimo``

- ``gh-users list``: Fetch and display a list of all users stored in the database.
  - You can filter the results by using optional parameters:
    - -l <location> or --location <location>: Filter users by location.
    - -p <programmingLanguage> or --programmingLanguage <programmingLanguage>: Filter users by programming language.
    - Example: ``gh-users list -l "US" -p "Java"``
      - Expected behavior: Fetches and displays users who are located in the US and have experience with Java.

## Other project commands (scripts)
- ``npm run lint``: Check the code for compliance with the defined formatting rules:
  - Max line length: 80 characters.
  - Indentation: 2 spaces (no tabs).
- ``npm run reset-db``: Reset the database by purging its tables. Afterward, run ``npm run migrations`` to recreate the tables.
- ``npm run test <testFileName.test.ts>``: Run tests using Jest.

## Technical choices
### Commander.js (CLI Tool)
Commander.js is a popular npm package used to build CLI applications in Node.js. While it is possible to create a CLI parser using process.argv, Commander.js was chosen for this project due to its reliable and easy-to-use functionality. It simplifies command definition, argument handling, and help message display, which helps reducing development time, improves maintainability, and enhances the user experience. ðŸš€
