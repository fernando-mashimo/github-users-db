# github-users-db
This application retrieves, persists and displays users' data from GitHub through CLI commands. It's been designed to run in Node.js (version 18 or above recommended).

Before running any command on terminal, please make sure that:
- you have Node.js installed (version 18 or later recommended):
  - run the command "node -v" in the terminal.
    - if the output format is like "v18.xx.y", you are good to go.
    - otherwise, you should install Node.
      - At first, install NVM. See: ðŸ”— https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
      - Proceed installing Node.js through NVM commands.
- you have Docker and Docker Compose installed and ready
  - if you do not have any of these components ready, see:
    - ðŸ”— **Docker**: [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
    - ðŸ”— **Docker Compose**: [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)  
- you have a GitHub personal access token (classic)
  - in case you still do not hold an access token, see:
  ðŸ”— https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic
- you have created a .env file in the project root directory and added the following variables:
  - GITHUB_API_TOKEN="your GitHub personal access token"
  - DB_HOST=localhost
  - DB_PORT=5432
  - DB_NAME=github-db
  - DB_USER=postgres
  - DB_PASSWORD=postgres

Now, let's enable the local environment to run the application. Please, run the following commands:
- npm install: to install required Node packages;
- docker compose up -d: to start up the database container
- npm run migrations: to create the database tables
  - alternatively run "npm run migrations:seeds" to also seed tables with fictional data

Additional commands:
- npm run lint: checks code compliance to the defined formatting rules:
  - line max length: 80 chars;
  - indentation: 2 spaces, no tab;
- npm run reset-db: in case you wish to purge database tables

TO DO:
- add an Entity Relationship Diagram, if needed
- update env.example
